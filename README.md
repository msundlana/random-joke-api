### Environment Variables

Ensure that you have added your Java and Maven installations to your `PATH` and that the `JAVA_HOME` and `MAVEN_HOME`
environment variables are set appropriately

## Getting Started

To clone repository, run the following commands on a terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/msundlana/random-joke-api.git` this will clone the repository onto your local machine.

### Running the API

To run the api you will need to do the following

1. Setting up the application
    1. Install dependencies using `mvn clean install` or `mvn clean install -P ${PROFILE_NAME}`
       `${PROFILE_NAME} = dev|prod|test`
    2. If running through the terminal
        1. Build the application using `mvn package`
        2. Start the app
           using `mvn spring-boot:run` ([Other Spring Boot Scripts here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#goals))
    3. If running with your IDE just hit the play button on `RecipeManagementServiceApplication.java`
    4. If running using docker 
       - Update [`.env`](.env) file with environmental variables used to configure the database 
        connection settings in the [`application-prod.properties`](./src/main/resources/application-prod.properties) directory:
        `USERNAME=your_username
         PASSWORD=your_password
       `
       - Replace `your_username` and `your_password`with your actual user credentials (Spring boot security currently disabled) and
       - To build the API docker image, run  `mvn spring-boot:build-image -P ${PROFILE_NAME}`
         `${PROFILE_NAME} = dev|prod|test`
       - To run the docker image, run `docker-compose up -d`
   5. The application will start
   6. Once the App is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. 
   7. Once the App is running you can view the OpenAPI Doc at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
   8. Once the App is running you can also view `http://localhost:8080/actuator`
       and the health of the application on `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`. Monitoring our app, gathering
       metrics, and understanding traffic or the state of our database is trivial.
       The actuator mainly exposes operational information about the running application â€” health, metrics, info, dump,
       env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
   9. For Distributed Tracing http://localhost:9411/zipkin, only configured under the `prod` profile allowing.


### Running the tests

This project uses the [spring-boot-starter-test](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.7.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html) framework with the
[Maven Artifact](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-test) plugin to run the full suite of tests.
Tests are annotation with @Test .

To run all tests simply execute `mvn test` from the project root. Alternatively if you are using Intellij right-click on the respective xml file and select run.
